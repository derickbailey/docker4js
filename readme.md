# Docker for JavaScript Developers

**Instructor: Derick Bailey**

JavaScript moves fast. Both the language, and the frameworks and tooling around it are receiving updates at an enormous rate these days. 

This pace of change oftens means a project you worked on a few months ago is now using "outdated" tools and technologies compared to your current project. And the older a project gets, the more difficult it is to maintain a development environment that supports the older libraries and runtime requirements.

In the past, developers have tried to solve these problems with configuration management tools, library dependency and versioning tools, full-on virtual machines to duplicate entire development environments, and more. But configuration drift is a problem that version management can't always solve, and duplicating your entire development environment is the easiest way to introduce configuration drift (among other things).

Enter Docker.

Docker is virtualization at the application level, encapsulating a single application process with all of it's configuration, runtime environment and dependencies. It will help you solve the "works on my machine" problem by nearly eliminating the need to configure the machine on which it runs. You deploy the application as an immutable binary object, and all of it's configuration and runtime environment come with it.

That means you no longer have to worry about what version of Node.js your old project is using. You don't need to re-install Babel.js v5 for an old project, and then v6 again for a new project. You can test the latest and greatest webpack, browserify and other tooling with zero conflict in your current projects.

And in this course, you'll learn how to do all of this and more, with Docker for JavaScript developers.

## Course Outline

In this 2 day course, you'll learn the core of what Docker is, how it works, how you can take advantage of it as a developer working on multiple projects or with multiple technologies, and how to effectively and efficiently use docker in your day-to-day development efforts. 

* Day 1: The Basics of Docker
  * 1.1 What is Docker?
  * 1.2 Getting Started
  * 1.3 Image and Container Management
  * 1.4 Docker for Local Services
  * 1.5 Build Your First Image
  * 1.6 Containing Node.js
  * 1.7 Containing Express.js
* Day 2: Developing In Docker
  * 2.1 Development vs Production Images
  * 2.2 Caching npm modules
  * 2.3 Editing Code in a Container
  * 2.4 Debugging in a Container
  * 2.5 Build Tools
  * 2.6 Docker-Compose

## About The Instructor

My name is Derick Bailey.

I'm a JavaScript developer, a speaker and a published author. I've been writing code since 1988, and doing it professionally since the mid 90's. I've been a prolific blogger since 2004 and have been delivering world-class training to developers all around the world, through on-site classes, screencasts, ebooks and more, since 2010.

I've spent a lifetime (more than 20 years) building software for leading financial organizations and airlines, the U.S. government, and more. I've created critical systems for large healthcare organizations, saving them millions of dollars a year. I've helped small-town, independently owned businesses improve their bottom line with simple software solutions and complex process automation.

And I've helped countless developers through sites like Stack Overflow, writing sample code for Microsoft's MSDN library, by publishing dozens of leading open source projects, including the most widely used add-on for Backbone.js (Marionette.js) and more.

Now, I want to help you and your team get up to speed with a technology that is changing the very nature of software development, deployment and production management. 

With my Docker for JavaScript Developers course, you'll be ahead of the curve and working effectively with Docker in record time. Encapsulate your applications and protect them against configuration drift, while providing a rock-solid environment in which you can support multiple projects with differing versions of runtime libraries and dependencies.

Docker is the future of software development, and I'm here to help you turn it's potential into productivity.
