# Section 1.7: Containing Express.js

In this module, you'll learn how to take a more feature-rich application and contain it inside
of Docker. You'll expose TCP/IP ports, ensure you have all dependencies for the application,
and run the container with all of the options you need to connect to MongoDB and view the app
from your localhost.
