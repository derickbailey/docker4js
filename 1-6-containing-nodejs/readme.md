# Section 1.6 - Containing Node.js

In this section you'll learn the basics of getting a Node.js application to run inside of a Docker container.

From base image selection, to a simple script and out to a an application that uses npm modules, you'll have everything to get started with Node.js by the end.

# Build and Run the Sample Code

This section is split into multiple parts, each of which build on each other progressivesly.

You'll want to start with Example #1 and move on to each, in turn.

## Example 1: console.log

Choose a base Node.js image and execute a simple `console.log` script.

## Example 2: Requiring Your Files

Make a more "complex" app with multiple files, and ensure they can be required into the main entry script, from within the Docker container.

## Example 3: Require npm Packages

Add the `chalk` library to your script output, using npm. Then add some color to your console.log statements!
